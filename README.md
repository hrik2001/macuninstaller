MacUninstaller
-------------
It is an app uninstaller for macOS which is being developed by Shatabarto "Rik" Bhattacharya. It is being written in python 2.7 purely

Usage
-----
So after downloading this all you have to do is </br>
`python cli.py -p /path/to/app` </br>
and it will output the possible files and folders that are related to the app you just specified. </br>
You can also do a custom scan where you have to type the path of the app and the directories in which you want to search for files affiliated with the app. </br>
`python cli.py -p /path/to/app -c /path1/ /path2/ /path3/`

Help Needed
-----------
Help is needed for GUI tho.
